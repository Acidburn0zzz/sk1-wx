Before building package please ensure that you have installed compiler and other
build tools:

pacman -S base-devel
pacman -S abs

This commands you need to execute as a root.

After that you need running package build in current directory where PKGBUILD
file for sk1 is located:

makepkg -s

As a result you will get package file like: sk1-2.0rc3-x64.pkg.tar.gz

You could install it using UI tools or using command:

pacman -U <package_name>.pkg.tar.gz
